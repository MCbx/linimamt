Hey, this is probably a less-than-ideal way to get a hold of you, but I couldn't find any other way.

I just wanted to say that I really think your oldcomputer.info site is really awesome, and I really like it. It was a good
find, and I really look forward to reading it.

I found your site in google search results for Linux AMD K6-2, because I'm trying to find a decent Linux distro to install
on my Toshiba Satellite 2065CDS. It has an AMD K6-2 @ 366 MHz.

Anyway, feel free to delete this; I simply just wanted to tell you how much I like your site.

Have a good day,
s0s
